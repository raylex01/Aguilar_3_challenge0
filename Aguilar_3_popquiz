What are the differences between MIT and GPL licenses? Which one will we use 
in here?

MIT licenses give you complete control and allows you to  see the source code and modify it or change it.
GPL does not allow you to control everything but allows you to modify or redistribute without seeing the source code.
We will use GPL because we arew students who can not be trusted with MIT and having that much control.
